This project belongs to John Smilga. I'm, as a beginner, doing the project for exercise purposes. John Smilga let us download and redo the project from his GitHub profile, the link will be down below. I'm grateful to him that he teaches web development very efficiently and he gives all the resources for free on YouTube. It is such a massive help for students like us who cannot afford paid courses. I again thank John Smilga sir for his kind deeds.
